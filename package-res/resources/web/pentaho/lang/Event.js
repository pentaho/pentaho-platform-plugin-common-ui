    /**
     * @classDesc The `Event` class is the base class of event objects emitted by an
     * [EventSource]{@link pentaho.lang.EventSource}.
     *
     * The source of an event is the object that emits it and
     * is given by its [source]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#source} property.
     *
     * ##### Event Type
     *
     * Events have a _type_ that is given by its [type]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#type} property.
     * The type of an event is the _id_ used to register to it,
     * using [EventSource#on]{@link pentaho.lang.EventSource#on}.
     *
     * An event type corresponds to a single subclass of `Event`.
     * However, an `Event` subclass can be used by several event types.
     * The `Event` subclass of an event type mainly depends on the data that it is associated with.
     *
     * ##### Event Cancellation
     *
     * Certain types of events are used to signal that an _action_ is about to execute
     * (or that a phase of an already executing action is about to start).
     * When the execution of the action can be canceled by the event listeners,
     * the event is said to be _cancelable_.
     * That characteristic is exposed by the [isCancelable]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#isCancelable} property.
     *
     * When an event is canceled, its corresponding action is also canceled and
     * the listeners of unprocessed registrations are not notified.
     *
     * To cancel an event, call its [cancel]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#cancel} method.
     * To find out if an event has been canceled, read the [isCanceled]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#isCanceled} property.
     *
     * ##### Persistable Events
     *
     * Certain types of events are emitted so frequently that it
     * makes it highly beneficial to reuse event objects.
     * To safely use an event object beyond its emission,
     * a cloned event object must be obtained,
     * through [clone]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#clone}.
     *
     * @name Event
     * @memberOf pentaho.lang
     * @class

     * @constructor

     * @param {!Object} source - The object where the event will be initially emitted.
     * @param {?boolean} [cancelable=false] - Indicates if the event can be canceled.
