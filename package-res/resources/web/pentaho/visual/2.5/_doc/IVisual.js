/**
 * Visualization instances, or for short, _visuals_, must implement this interface.
 *
 * #### Visual Implementation
 *
 * Visuals may be implemented using any JavaScript library.
 * What matters is that the here described contract is respected.
 *
 * #### Mandatory and Optional Members
 *
 * The visual interface has a single mandatory member â€”
 * the {{#crossLink "IVisual/draw:method"}}{{/crossLink}} method.
 * Construction of visuals is abstracted away
 * through the use of a factory function (see next section).
 * The remaining methods _can_ be implemented by visuals
 * to expose richer functionality.
 *
 * #### Visual Construction
 *
 * In older versions of the VisualAPI (< 3.0), the `IVisual` interface
 * required a constructor that received the DOM element as argument.
 *
 * The visual constructor, of a certain
 * {{#crossLink "IVisualType"}}visual type{{/crossLink}},
 * was accessible in the global property
 * specified in {{#crossLink "IVisualType/class:property"}}{{/crossLink}},
 * and the VisualAPI constructed the instance directly.
 * This form is still supported, but only for legacy, non-AMD visualizations.
 *
 * The new AMD visualizations aren't constructed directly by the VisualAPI anymore.
 * The new {{#crossLink "IVisualType/factory:property"}}{{/crossLink}} property,
 * can contain:
 * 1. a factory function, than can be synchronous or asynchronous (return a promise for the visual)
 * 2. a string that is the name of a module whose value is a factory function.
 *
 * The factory function is responsible for constructing the visuals.
 *
 * @class IVisual
 * @constructor

/**
 * **Optional** event that is triggered by a visual whenever
 * the current highlights are changed
 * in response to an internally initiated action.
 *
 * A visual that triggers this event **must** also implement the
 * {{#crossLink "IVisual/setHighlights:method"}}{{/crossLink}} method
 * (although the reverse isn't required).
 *
 * Both _selections_ and _selectionMode_ can be changed by handlers of the event.
 * It is the final values of these which will determine the new highlights.
 * If the final _selections_ are actually different from the current highlights,
 * the visual's {{#crossLink "IVisual/setHighlights:method"}}{{/crossLink}} method
 * is subsequently called to inform it of the new highlights.
 *
 * @event select
 *
 * @param {IVisual} source The visual that triggered the event.
 * @param {Array} selections An array of {{#crossLink "ISelection"}}{{/crossLink}}.
 * @param {String} [selectionMode="REPLACE"] The mode by which the specified _selections_
 *    are combined with the current highlights.
 *    See {{#crossLink "SelectionMode"}}{{/crossLink}} for a list of possible selection modes.

 * and affect subsequent handlers.

 * (having, however, updated "width" and "height" properties).

 * if it can perform a resize operation more efficiently
 * than a re-draw.

 * The container must take care of resizing the container DOM element
 * before calling this method.
