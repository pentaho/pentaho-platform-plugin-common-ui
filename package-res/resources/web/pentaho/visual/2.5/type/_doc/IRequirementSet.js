/**
 * This interface is a **documentation artifact** that describes

 *
 * A **requirements set** describes one way in which a visual type can be used.
 * Yet, most visual types only define a single set.
 *
 * Requirements are satisfied by the creator of a visual.
 * Visual-containers, like Pentaho Analyzer, present a user interface that
 * allows end users to specify values for each of the visual's requirements.
 *
 * {{#crossLink "spec.IVisual"}}Visual specifications{{/crossLink}},
 * contain the values of requirements as same name properties.
 *
 * Visuals receive specifications to be
 * {{#crossLink "IVisual/draw:method"}}drawn{{/crossLink}} as an object,
 * of type {{#crossLink "spec.IVisualDraw"}}{{/crossLink}} â€”
 * a sub-type of {{#crossLink "spec.IVisual"}}{{/crossLink}}.
 *
 * Note that, of the following properties, those not having a default value are **required**.
