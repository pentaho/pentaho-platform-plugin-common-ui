     * @classDesc The `Event` class is the base class of a certain kind of event objects that can be
     * emitted by [event sources]{@link pentaho.lang.EventSource}.
     *
     * The source of an event is the object that emits it and
     * is given by the event's [source]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#source} property.
     *
     * The type of an event is given by its [type]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#type} property.
     *
     * ##### Event Cancellation
     *
     * Certain types of events are used to signal that an _action_ is about to execute
     * (or that a phase of an already executing action is about to start).
     * When the execution of the action can be canceled by the event listeners,
     * the event is said to be _cancelable_.
     * That characteristic is exposed by the [isCancelable]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#isCancelable} property.
     *
     * When an event is canceled, the listeners of unprocessed registrations are not notified.
     *
     * To cancel an event, call its [cancel]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#cancel} method.
     * To find out if an event has been canceled, read the [isCanceled]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#isCanceled} property.
     *
     * ##### Persistable Events
     *
     * Certain types of events are emitted so frequently that it
     * makes it highly beneficial to reuse event objects.
     * To safely use an event object beyond its emission,
     * a cloned event object must be obtained,
     * through [clone]{@link pentaho.lang.Event#clone}.
     *
