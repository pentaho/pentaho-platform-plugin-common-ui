/**
 * A `spec.Complex` represents the union of JS types that can be used to describe a complex value.
 *
 * Like with all other value types, complex values can be described using the general **object form**.
 * The _object form_ conforms to {@link pentaho.type.spec.IComplex}.
 *
 * Complex values support an additional form of value specification, the **array form**:
 * an array of {@link pentaho.type.spec.Instance},
 * each the specification of the value of one of a complex's properties,
 * in property definition order,
 * according to [PropertyType#index]{@link pentaho.type.PropertyType#index}.
 *
 * Take the following _object form_ example:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   product: "boeing-737",
 *   price:   1500
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Assuming that the two properties were defined in the order `"product"` then `"price"`,
 * it could be written in _array form_, like this:
 *
 * ```js
 * ["boeing-737", 1500]
 * ```
 *
 * However, note that _array form_ can only be used if
 * the [inline type]{@link pentaho.type.spec.IInstance#_} property can, in fact, be omitted.
 *
 * @typedef {pentaho.type.spec.IComplex|Array.<?pentaho.type.spec.Instance>} pentaho.type.spec.Complex
