/**
 * A `spec.EnvironmentPropertyFilter` represents the union of JS types that can be used to
 * filter the value of an [environment variable]{@link pentaho.environment.IEnvironment},
 * in the [select]{@link pentaho.config.spec.IRule#select} attribute
 * of a type configuration rule.
 *
 * A {@link Nully} filter is equivalent to not filtering a variable.
 * When unfiltered, any environment variable value is matched.
 *
 * An array filter matches an environment variable if any of the values in the array
 * are the same exact value of the environment variable.
 *
 * Any other value is assumed to be a single value, and matches the environment variable
 * if it is the same value.
