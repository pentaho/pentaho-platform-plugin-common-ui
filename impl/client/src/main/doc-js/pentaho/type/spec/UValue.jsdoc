 * A `spec.Value` represents the union of JS types that can be used to describe a value instance.
 *
 * When a value instance is described using _object form_,
 * its specification is of type [spec.IValue]{@link pentaho.type.spec.IValue}.
 *
 * To describe an absent instance, use a {@link Nully} JavaScript value.
