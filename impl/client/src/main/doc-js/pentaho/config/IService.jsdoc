/**
 * The `config.IService` interface describes a service
 * that manages configurations, usually of types.
 *
 * The platform's main configuration service instance can be obtained by requiring
 * the module `pentaho/service!pentaho.config.IService?single`.
 *
 * The platform registers an instance module that
 * loads all registered configuration rule set modules
 * (i.e., modules of type {@link pentaho.config.spec.IRuleSet}).
 *
 * The [add]{@link pentaho.config.IService#add} method
 * is used to register a [config.spec.IRuleSet]{@link pentaho.config.spec.IRuleSet}
 * to the service.
 *
 * The [select]{@link pentaho.config.IService#select} method
 * selects the rules of added configurations that apply to
 * a given type and context variables,
 * sorts these by specificity,
 * then merges the rules' [specifications]{@link pentaho.config.spec.IRule#apply}
 * and returns the result.
 * For more information on the specificity of rules,
 * see [config.spec.IRuleSet]{@link pentaho.config.spec.IRuleSet}.
 *
 * The merged configuration specification can then be used to configure a type or an instance.
 *
 * Normally, you won't call these operations directly.
 *
 * Then, the [Context]{@link pentaho.type.Context} class
 * already handles obtaining configurations from its configuration service,
 * and applying these to the requested value types.
 *
 * The following example illustrates how an implementation of this service would be used:
 *
 * ```js
 * var myTypeConfig = {
 *   rules: [
 *     // Disable a still experimental component.
 *     {
 *       select: {
 *         type: "my.foo.component"
 *       },
 *       apply: {
 *         enabled: false
 *       }
 *     },
 *
 *     // Enable it, only for the dev user, "john", and the "super-app" application.
 *     {
 *       select: {
 *         type:        "my.foo.component",
 *         user:        "john",
 *         application: "super-app"
 *       },
 *       apply: {
 *         enabled: true
 *       }
 *     }
 *   ]
 * };
 *
 * var configService = new SomeConfigurationService();
 *
 * configService.add(myTypeConfig);
 *
 * var mergedConfigSpec = configService.select("my.foo.component", {
 *      user:        "john",
 *      application: "not-so-super-app"
 *    });
 *
 * // Results in a configuration specification like:
 * // {
 * //   enabled: false
 * // }
 * ```
 *
 * @name pentaho.config.IService
 * @interface
 *
 * @see pentaho.config.spec.IRuleSet
